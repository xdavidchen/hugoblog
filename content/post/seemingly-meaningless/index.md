Life is made up of *seemingly meaningless work*.

The courses you took that were irrelevant to the real life scenario. The business conversations without any follow-up. The uninspiring conferences you attended. 

Tasks that are necessary to complete but don't produce any direct result. These are the *seemingly meaningless work*. Nobody is going to see it. Nobody cares. It looks like all the efforts are in vain.

But what you don’t see is the belief system we're building underneath the hood.

From a creator's perspective, it's posting articles that nobody noticed. It's uploading videos and we are the only people who care. It's taking a thousand photos with that expensive DSLR camera and none of those would even landed in an editing software.

Every single *seemingly meaningless work* we do contribute to the creative ecosystem we’re improving on.

Every article we write shapes our thinking and refines our philosophy. Every video we make helps us excel creative skills and accelerate workflow. Every photo we take challenges us to find a new perspective.

Believe in *seemingly meaningless work*. Document the journey. Build your own success.
