When it comes to goal setting, reverse engineering has become my second nature during the planning process.

The best part about reverse engineering a goal is having a very clear path about how to get “there.”

Normally, the steps toward the goal is continual sets of qualifications (or requirements) we need to meet. Take moving to a new country, for example, you have to go through a long process that often includes the following:
- Interviews
- Education
- VISA applications
- Background checks
- …and so on

With each sub-goals, you have more minor goals like notarizing document or meeting a certain level of income standard. The end goal we’ve reverse-engineered is still “moving to a new country..”

The biggest problem though, is that by reverse-engineering a goal, we become extremely goal-oriented and forget to enjoy the process.

With the goal-oriented mindset, it’s difficult to keep a steady momentum. Instead, we are on emotional roller coasters. Good days are amazing. Bad days suck.

That explains the importance of documenting life.\
It’s not exciting. But it reminds us to enjoy the process. And when we feel like, it gives us a chance to look back.

**It’s not just about the getting.** It’s more about the making. In fact, when well planned-out, it should be **all about the making**.
