As an aspiring creator, I've heard this so many times that I might puke the next time I hear it.

**No.**
The best time isn't now.

"The best time is now" only sounds convincing from already successful creators. And only they have the position to say that. Suddenly, all the people around you encourage you to start creating now.

"Start with what you have." Easy for them to say.

Remember this: what you post, publish, or show is how your audience learn who you are as a person.

If you're not fine with who you currently are, or don't feel good about your work, then stop forcing yourself to start now.

Change what you don't like about you and your work.

Until then, **the best time isn't now**.
