I’m not only a low-key neat freak. I’m also a “critical thinking freak”.

Being a critical thinking freak means you set filters for your information sources.

Theses sources are most of the time credible and thought-provoking so that even you, being the reader, has consumed the information and gone through the whole critical thinking process, still find the [information helpful in any way](https://xdavidchen.com/p/ie-not-the-browser/).

This makes you **focus on what matters**.

Be a critical thinking freak so you can develop your own thinking and see things clearly.
