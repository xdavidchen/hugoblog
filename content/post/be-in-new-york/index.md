“You always make it there, you make it anywhere” sings Frank Sinatra in "New York, New York."

Things won’t always go the way we wanted. In fact, most of the time they won’t.

So staying resilient is a vital mindset to have, especially when the world is changing so fast.

If we are able to adjust our mindset in difficult situations, we will be able to go one extra mile.

And every extra mile holds accountable for our success.
