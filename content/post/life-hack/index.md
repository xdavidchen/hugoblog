When you finally sort out everything, and all seems to work smoothlyâ€¦ you don't feel like it anymore.

You're in the "downs" in life. You feel trapped. Nothing exact is wrong. It's just that something about life doesn't feel right.

We've all been there.\
A shot of motivational booster can't help us either.\
Whether that is an actual whiskey shot or the cannabis you're smoking.

Life forces you to go on.\
There are deadlines to meet, responsibilities you can't avoid, people you never want to disappoint.

How can we take back the control rather than being forced to adapt passively?

The secret? Change your environment.\
A different environment stimulates your senses. To get inspired is all you need.\
You gain insights. You discover opportunities. You start to appreciate life.
