Anyone who thinks life is like a marathon is crazy. That fool has neither wisdom nor honesty.

In a marathon, you only rest at the end. Since you are being chased by time, you are either running or walking. You **must** be moving. If you don't, you're out.

In a marathon, **you are always exhausted**.

Life isn't like a marathon. It'd better not be.\
Life is a series of sprint after sprint, with **long breaks** in between.

You are at break most of the time. You are allowed to rest. You are not obligated to keep moving. You can just stop and take a pause. Have fun. Relax. Think. Create. Do whatever you feel like, as long as that keeps you in a good state of mind.

You **only run when you need**. Run as *fast* as possible. Run as *efficiently* as you can. Run to that finish line.

You need those long breaks. Long breaks long enough until you are ready for the next sprint. Long breaks not too overly-long to lose your momentum.

It applies to learning, to work, to relationships. To all.

Finish the sprint. Take high quality breaks. Thereâ€™s another one coming.
