Every social media is a personalized content feed **with ads**. Depending on the algorithm, you might see content you find interesting and relevant. But there are garbage too, if you’re being honest. The ads aren’t much better than those garbage either, if not worse.

If you truly want to get helpful information, not just entertaining drugs, an RSS feed is perfect for you.

1. Go to a website which you enjoy consuming information from.
2. Find and copy the RSS url. Here’s [how](https://themeisle.com/blog/how-to-find-the-rss-feed-of-a-website/).
3. Paste the link into your RSS reader. If you’re using Apple devices, I recommend [Net News Wire](https://netnewswire.com/), free and open source.

There you go. A clean and helpful content feed just for you.
