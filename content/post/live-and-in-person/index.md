Being “live” as in a "Live TV show" isn’t enough. Not long after, AI will be capable of generating live motion graphics and interacting with audience online.

Being “in-person” isn’t enough. When the museum displays an AI art (either intentionally or not), there’s a high chance we can’t spot it. As [AI has won an art prize in a competition](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html)[^1].

To compete against AI is to make it less interesting. The way we do it is by showing the proofs of living.

**The proof is you doing your craft**, *live and in-person*. Musicians or singers performing, *live and in-person*. Experts delivering speeches, *live and in-person*. Human initiating conversations, *live and in-person*.

When the hype around AI is **everywhere**, the hype is **nowhere**.

Treat AI as a means to an end. That end is your craft, *live and in-person*.
