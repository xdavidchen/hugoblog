To get into your creative flow, you need to create a zone and get into it.

- Private or public?
- Quiet or noisy?
- Bright or dark?
- Clean or messy?
- Cool or warm?
- Dry or humid?
- Analog or digital?
- A time block or chunks?

Knowing the answers to these questions allows you to create an ideal environment for maximum productivity.

As long as your current conditions are true to your answers, you can find the flow no matter where you are.
