In the Asia educational system, 60 is the grade for passing.

What tasks are on your to-do list? Just by thinking about how many hours, or even days a single task would take for you to tick it off, do they intimidate you from starting working on it?

What if everything could be easier?

We can all agree with the benefits of starting from 0. We'd have much sense of achievement. We'd make it 100% the way we want it. The work is **us**. It's who we are. Majestic.

The feeling of starting from 0 and completing the work is beyond words. But the cost that comes with the process is obvious: *the drained you*.

How about we start from 59?

I suppose by now you've completed a number of projects from scratch. During the making, you must have had the same feeling as I had before. The feeling that someone must have done some parts of the work before, and that much of our time is wasted on doing things that already exist.

If we start from 59, it means we're building our work on other's work.

You don't have to shoot all the footage. There's stock library you can use for free. You don't have to prepare teaching materials from the beginning. Countless teachers are sharing theirs online. This applies to everything you're working on.

From 59, we'll reach goals faster, delivering the same (or better) quality of work.

One thing to point out, though, is that we can't just take others' work and claim it's our own. That's shipping 59 work. And that's a **fail** on the transcript.

We should customize it. We should add our personal touches. We should credit the original creator of the work where necessary.

The next time you feel overwhelmed by your to-do list, start from 59.
