You might be a musician, professor, salesperson, or any other job occupation you identify with.\
No matter what kind of craft you are working on, there will be a point when you don't know if you should show it to the public.

Publicly showing your work when [it's not the right time](https://xdavidchen.com/p/the-best-time-is-not-now/) can be discouraging, for both you and your audience. When there is a slight sense of missing genuine, all of us would notice.

Show your work, when it meets the following criteria:
1. You don't feel embarrassed about it **now**.\
How to know you don't feel embarrassed? Easy.\
You are **proud** of it. You feel the **urge** to share.

We will always be embarrassed by our past works in the future.\
We ought to. This proves we're learning and growing, or just moving on in some ways.

2. You've put something useful into your work.\
To remember this, think ["IE"](https://xdavidchen.com/p/ie-not-the-browser/).

3. It's time.\
At some point, you have to [show your work](https://xdavidchen.com/p/make-as-many-mvps-as-possible/) to the public. You have a voice. And it matters.
