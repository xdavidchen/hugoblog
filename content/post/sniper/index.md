Is battlefield chaotic and messy? Yes.\
Do snipers panic in war field? No.

They see through the sniper scope, aim, and shoot.

They know what the goal is. They know it and do it quick. They kill one target at a time. **The target**. And they move on to the next one.

Life can be like a war. To clear tasks is to stay alive. Act like a sniper to win your battle in life.
