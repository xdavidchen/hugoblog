One equal trait to all human is we are born with inequality. Another thing that’s equal to all is how much time we have.

The slower you live your life, the longer your day becomes.

People who choose the fast-paced lifestyle live short. While all of us are figuring out our lives, the fast-paced lifestyle prevents you from taking a break. Pausing in life. Looking back at the progress. Taking care of friends and family.

Things move fast. Fast-paced lifestyle keeps you busy. To people who live fast, time flies faster.

If you choose slow living, then [life isn’t short](https://dkb.show/post/life-is-not-short).

You spend your time on things that matter. You work hard. Play hard. Relax harder. You know when to do what and why you do it. You live a life with intention.
