This customer is someone whoâ€¦
- recognizes what he/she wants from this social interaction;
- perceives the value of the product or service that he/she is going to exchange with money;
- empathizes with the one who's serving no matter of occupation;
- realizes other people are devoting their life into their work;
- feels grateful for all the people involved just to make it work. (Nothing is overpriced);
- **doesn't** expect extra value more than what he/she paid for. (Do you think waiters always have to fill the glass?);
- **doesn't** criticize the extra service he/she is getting;
- spreads out good words when properly pleased;
- is well educated to know all human born equal, and spending money to get the product or service doesn't make anyone superior.
