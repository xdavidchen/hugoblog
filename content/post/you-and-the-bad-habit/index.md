The cost of me spending the whole night playing League of Legends was my not-the-best academic performance. It mattered because the personal value of a Taiwanese student is defined by his grades at school, and the society buys into this notion. So back in high school, playing League was a bad habit of mine.

But now? Spending hours playing the game is my way of enjoying life.

To decide if a habit is good or bad, think of the cost of the habit. You are the main character here. What’s the cost for you to keep that habit? Does it make your life fall apart? Does it do more harm than benefits?

You define when a habit is “bad", because you will be the one who will change the ways of thinking and behaviors, not other people. Bad habits from the past might not be bad anymore. Good habits in memory can be bad now. You are the only one that matter.
