"Would people believe me?"\
"How can I create trust?"\
Common questions from the inner voice as a creator.

In college, we could have used some scientific research to prove our arguments.

What about in life? Is there a way to prove our thoughts to be correct? What if we don't know what we're talking about? What if we were only *impostors*?

**Be you**. People can tell whether you're being truthful.

Being truthful is being extremely personal. Your personal experience creates authenticity. Authenticity creates intimacy, honesty, and vulnerability. Sharing personal stories is more believable than scientific research. It is also more interesting, for sure.

No other people could steal your own experience. If they can, you're not being personal enough. And you don't have to bother, because no one would care.

Fake it and you won't make it. More true in it phrased this way, for a creator.
