Performing a search is similar to mining.\
The information, the ultimate answer you're looking for is the gold.

When you're mining and you don't find gold in this hill, you'd go to another one. You wouldn't spend your whole life digging deeper into the same one.

When you perform a search, and you can't find the answer to your question, you go to another place to find the gold.

Change your search engine, and they will show you different results.\
Go into niched forums, and you may even come across diamonds.\
Take all the paths to every mine you can find. You will get the gold.
