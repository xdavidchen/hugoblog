We think of global warming when talking about energy crisis.\
When I talk about energy crisis, I mean **your energy**.

I learned this lesson the hard way back in college.

I used to be a busy bee.\
I thought about work all day.\
I got anxious just by thinking about it.

It got me to a point where I would be sitting in the classroom with my laptop on, switching between windows on my Mac with three fingers, endlessly for minutes.\
A friend of mine sitting next to me would ask with confusion: "*What are you even trying to do?*"

Eventually, this kind of repetitive and anxious behavior would lead me to depression.

Well yes, I'm still a workaholic nowadays.\
Except that I work smarter by paying attention to my energy status.

If you are aware of your energy status, you'll be able to
- finish work with high efficiency.
- know where the boundaries are.
- learn how to rest well.

**Find the certain time in a day for the certain tasks.**

Let's end the energy crisis together.
