All this refers to the birth stage of content creation.

Photographers wait for that golden hour to shoot the best exposed photos. It shouldn't be too difficult to know when the time is, as long as we Google the daytime of sunrise and sunset on the shoot day. Twice a day, not on rainy days.

It's a bit more complicated for writing.

Golden hour doesn't exist.\
There's certain time you have a higher chance to feel inspired. There are certain people who give you more inspirations. None of these will let you predict when those inspirations would nurture their ways and become your own brilliant ideas.

It's common when we're all set to sit down and write, life becomes the least inspiring it could be; when we're having an uninspiring day, our idea pops up out of nowhere.

There would be consecutive days where we just don't have it. <!-- just write one ugly first draft OR edit old ugly first draft --> In this sense, it's much more difficult to have a good idea than photographers to get that perfect exposure.

Good news is there are days you would have multiple *golden minutes*, and you don't want to waste any of those.

Writers wait for *golden minute*. Moments when it clicks.
