An idea is an idea. It doesn’t matter which form it takes. An idea can be turned in to a text, single image, continuous images, audio signals…

They are better known as blog posts, videos, photographs, podcast episodes…

The key is you get the core idea. You know what you want to say to your audience. The rest is about the execution. Think which form you love the most, you’re capable of using, and is the best to deliver that idea.

As for those who are able to make a living by delivering ideas, they make their ideas [informational, interesting and / or inspiring](https://xdavidchen.com/p/ie-not-the-browser/).
