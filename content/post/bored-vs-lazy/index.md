Critical thinking is tiring.

That’s why people don’t do the thinking themselves. They give their consents to big techs that would feed them content. And people would consume all that.

Everyone is smart enough to figure out that being lazy won’t get you anywhere. It’s whether you admit it or not.

*Get bored*, however, is crucial.

When everyone else is busy with being lazy and fed with thoughtless content, bored people come up with revolutionary ideas.

Get bored. Create some mental spaces for your brain. And magical moments will come.
