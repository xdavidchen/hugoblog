Since the first post in 2021, this blog has undergone a lot of changes.

At the end of 2022, I’ve made up my mind to make this my personal website. The only purpose it serves is for me to post anything I’d like to share.

3 years ago, I started as an amateur in the field of content creation. I tried many forms of content. I tried filming and publishing videos on YouTube. I tried writing articles on Medium. I posted a few times on several online forums. None of those worked for me. There’s always something missing. Something I didn’t like about it.

A year ago, I decided that I should get to the fundamental form of content creation, focusing on ideas instead of their forms. Putting various factors into consideration, I started working on building this website you’re reading, and eventually this would be turned into a bilingual blog where I published different niches of content in 2 languages: creator’s life in English, and foreign country experience in Chinese.

Although I was satisfied with the decision about having a bilingual website with different content, which is innovative in the blogging community, I soon realized the reason why no one is doing this.

There are several problems about this, humane, technical, and organizational. To explain in simple words, it makes it difficult for people who aren’t bilingual to understand and navigate. The codes that are used for multilingual content were created by the engineering community to support translating content, not totally different content. Last but not least, it was also painful for me to organize my writing.

After seeing the above problems, I devoted myself into creating the version 2 of this blog, where design is still the same, but you’ll have same content in 2 different languages. And the original Chinese content has been migrated to [another website](https://davidchen.world/) that’s tailored made for it. I spent another month on building that one. If you can read Chinese and love stories, I recommend you check it out.

All these said, the v2 of this blog will have the following changes starting in 2023:
*  This is the only place you’ll connect with me personally. You can treat this website as my social media. I think that’s easier for people to understand.
*  There’s no content niche anymore. I share whatever I’d like to share.
*  Thumbnail isn’t a must anymore on this blog (as in this post).
*  For Chinese email followers, you’ll get updates in your email inbox from both this website and [davidchen.world](https://davidchen.world/)
*  New posts will come more frequently.
*  No guarantee if English or Chinese content would come first or together (if I think it makes sense to post in both languages, of course).

I hope you’re as excited as I am about this “new style” of content creation. I emphasized on new style because I’m talking about blogging. I think too many people are missing the treasure you’ll find through reading. And in terms of technology, it’s a step backward from all the creator platforms out there.
