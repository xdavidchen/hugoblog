The “**trust the process**” mindset can bring long-term benefits in many contexts.

For artists, only when the artists *trust the process* of making arts are they able to master the craft. In marketing, only when the makers *trust the process* of delivering remarkable products is word-of-mouth marketing going to work. Top athletes *trust the process* and give their best shot.

Worrying too much is not going to help. When you face a problem, either fix it or admit it. When you fix a problem, you are able to continue your journey. When you admit a problem, you understand that it won’t be solved and ignore it, so you are able to continue your journey.

Run into problems. Fix or admit problems. Get back to work. That’s how you trust the process.
