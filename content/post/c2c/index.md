As an introvert, the information I receive everyday is overwhelming. Among the overloaded information, only a fraction of them are inspiring - most of them are useless to me.

Recently, I'm having a stronger feeling that always being the passive receiver of information is not a good idea. That means we are always accepting other's opinion. The way we defend ourselves, as introverts, is only happening in our brains.

We rebel silently.

Growing up into adulthood, I realize rebelling in heads means no rebel.

Looking back at past few years, I now assume I was so suppressed that I tried to find a way to express myself. (I need to practice expressing my opinion without worrying taking a stand.)

So I tried to work on this concept called "personal brand". I uploaded videos onto YouTube. Wrote articles on Medium. Posted content on Instagram. All those seem appropriate to do while building a personal brand. I was trying hard to make the most out of my day and be as productive as possible.

The problem was that I didn't know what I believed in. Everything I was doing was like me shouting to nobody, adding more noise to the world (which I hate the most seeing other "creators" do).

Oh yeah. Did I mention I didn't even like what I was doing?

After some time attempting, I finally decided to stop and took a break, from almost everything.

The feeling you feel when you're back to the endless loop again.

During this "low point of life", I was doing things that I had been doing before trying to be a creator: looking at other people's successes, and got inspired by... few creators, sometimes.

I think, and rethink. I try to make sense of this impulsive feeling for self-expression. I haven't been able to figure out everything yet, about myself and this world. I boldly assume you haven't, either.

But there is one thing I clearly know.

I know that it's more difficult to be heard as an introvert. And that if I don't create, but only consume, then my whole life would be wasted in the circle of being inspired and being frustrated, instead of actually making some impacts.

Now I'm much more prepared.

I'm creating content, instead of just consuming.

This blog is where I'll be sharing anecdotes, development of skills, and reflection on life events.

You might be able to find some comfort here if you are also an introvert.

Visit me here once in awhile and let's keep in touch.

I look forward to bring positive energy to you, inspire you, and encourage you to do the same.

When you're ready.
