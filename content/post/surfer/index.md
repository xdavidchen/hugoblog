The ocean is enormous. We don't know what's in the deepest ocean. The ocean is beautiful. Even a man who can't swim knows that. We encounter surprises, emotions, and flows.

Once in a while the ocean is dangerous.

After a school of fish comes a shark. At its worst, human can get killed.<br>
Going too deep and lights won't get in.<br>
Don't be fooled by the magnificence. Don't dive too deep.

Try your best to become a surfer. Observe like how a pro surfer does. Observe the waves. Enjoy the rides.<br>
Occasionally, go down to explore just for the sake of fun.

Surf the *Internet* like a surfer.
