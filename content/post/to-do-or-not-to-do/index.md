Every time we make a life-changing decision, it's a battle of two factors: push and pull.

When Putin started the war, Ukrainians are *pushed* from their country.\
As they were considering where to flee to, they are *pulled* by the benefits of the country of destination.

Although war is an extreme example, the life-changing decisions we make in our lives aren't any less impactful.

Choosing a college major, getting a driver license, buying a backpackâ€¦\
However big or insignificant you think these decisions are, they can all be life-changing.

It's dangerous to make a decision before thinking it through. You need a strategy.\
The best one I've developed over the years is this: *Push* factors are always priority consideration.

The reason is simple.

You realize you want to run away from something.\
***Push* is a source of negativity.**

That wasn't enough to convince you? Fine. I'll also tell you why *pull* shouldn't be at top priority.

**We normalize everything.** This is pure human nature.

Would you enjoy a 5-day trip to Japan? Probably yes. Everything would be new and exciting.\
Would you enjoy living in Japan for 5 years? Not so much after 1 year of living and seeing the same scenery.

Everything that's new would seem appealing. But we'll eventually get used to it, and find it not appealing anymore.

Consider *push* factors first. *Pull* factors are extra bonus points.

**Just btw, there are six "o" letters in the title, and each word has one! Isn't that cute?*
