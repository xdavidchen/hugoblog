There are countless nights I spend lying on my bed, thinking what I can do to change.

To change the world for the better. To change someone’s mood. To change my personal financial situation. It could be anything. If you are any slightly dissatisfied with life in general, you know what I’m saying.

Most of those ideas turn out to be stupid ideas. I’m not going to invent a new banking system. I’m not going to build a new rental house platform for foreigners in Taiwan. I’m not going to read that rhymed, heart-pouring quatrain I wrote in my head and expect to change someone's mind...

Validating an idea then becomes easy.

If an idea remains exciting overnight, it’s a solid good idea.
