"No Limits" signs don't tell the full truth. Different cars have their own limits according to specs.

"The last free place," a.k.a Slab City in California desert, isn't all that free. You are not welcome to harm the community in any way, which makes much sense.

We have limited brain capacity. We have limited imagination. What if everything that seems to be "unlimited" is actually all very limited?

No matter how much the human race embraces freedom, the limits are always there. A life with limitless possibilities sounds charming and sexy, but knowing limitations are there helps us stay humble and focus.
