No matter how successful you are, there’s going to be *ups* and *downs* — one of the very few things that’s equal to all human beings.

And that’s amazing.

If you’re going through the *downs* of your life, it’s because of the *ups* you’ve had. Without the *ups*, you don’t know what *downs* means to you.

It’s amazing because this is only about you. Your personal situation applies to you. Not your friends, your family, nor an Internet celebrity. So **only you can decide** if you are going to change it or not.

Being in the “ups” all the time is boring. You get used to it. And you won’t cherish it.

There’s no drama.\
There’s no story.

<br>

<br>

It's almost like emptiness.

<br>

<br>

Go through the “*downs*.” Remember how it feels. And be prepare for the “*ups*” again.
