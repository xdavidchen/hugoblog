We've all heard the saying "Don't judge a book by its cover."\
Then how come we are inclined to "*judge someone's expertise by his / her bookshelf*?"

Buying books doesn't make you smart. It's about the *thinking*.\
Getting certificates don't tell how skillful a person is. It's about the *execution*.\
Creating a business strategy isn't going to make an entrepreneur successful. It's about the *product*. 

**It's always about the making.**
