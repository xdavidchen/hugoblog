"Opt out" is a term in the marketing field. You usually "opt out" in the settings page. You can opt out of cookies. You can opt out of notifications. You can opt out of subscriptions.

Opting out is a good way to prevent distraction.\
I like to think the word "OPT" as acronym of "Other People's Tasks".\
"OPT" out, then becomes "Other People's Tasks" out.

Opting out is a good way to prioritize yourself.\
Are the tasks you're working on today contributing to your personal goals?\
You have every right to make progresses in achieving your own goals before realizing someone else's.

"OPT out" first. "OPT in" placed second.
