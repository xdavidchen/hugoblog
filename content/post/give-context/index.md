Context is a the key in effective communication.

Sometimes it is a reason that supports a decision.
Sometimes it is detail behind a situation.
Sometimes it is a scenario about a problem.

Give the context in one or multiple paragraph(s), sentence(s), or word(s).
Give just enough.
You know what is enough when you think with empathy.
