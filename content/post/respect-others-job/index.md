Every job has its own difficulties.

We won’t understand other's difficulties unless we do the job ourselves.

Even we actually go and do the job ourselves, we won't get the full picture. We don’t live their lives. We never know what’s going on with other people’s lives.

The truth is that we will never fully empathize, no matter how hard we try.

If we wish others to respect our jobs, respect everyone else’s is the first thing to do.
