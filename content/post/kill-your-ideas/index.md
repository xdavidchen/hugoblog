Recently, I’ve been going through all the notes I’ve made all over the places. It’s been a tiring process so far, and it hasn’t come to an end.

If you've gone through this similar process of looking back at what you had noted, you might have the same experience. You can’t recall what you wrote and why you wanted to write these ideas down.

These notes are what people call the “fleeting notes” in Zettelkasten note-taking method. They are the random thoughts, [fragmented and unorganized inner thoughts](https://xdavidchen.com/p/fragmented-and-unorganized-inner-thoughts/) in our brains. To make Zettelkasten a powerful technique, we’ve done the first step correctly, which is to declutter by externalizing our thoughts. But **it’s only helpful if we process them further**.

It’s the best if we could look back at these fleeting notes, days, months, or years after and remember why we took the particular notes at the first place. Most of the time, that’s just not the case. So when going through old notes, this is what I’ve been doing, and I encourage you to do the same: kill your ideas.

**Be decisive**. If these thoughts from the past don’t make any sense to you now, they won’t in the future. Delete them. Declutter your brain. And focus on what matters.
