Decluttering floating information in our minds makes us relieve. Not being overloaded, we could focus on what matters the most at the moment.

What we often forget is that the information we’ve taken notes of were fragmented and unorganized. Even if we had visualized these thoughts, we still have to process them after. Some ways of processing include deleting them or making extended use of them. The only "*don't*" is to **not let them rest there**.

Letting these thoughts rest on notes without bothering them is giving them another place to wander. They’ll become your fragmented and unorganized inner thoughts again.
