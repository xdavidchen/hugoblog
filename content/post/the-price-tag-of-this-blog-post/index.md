Richard Feynman was a Nobel-prizewinning US theoretical physicist in the 20th centuries. A few days ago while I was doing my daily random scrolling on Hacker News, his name popped up with the quote, “Knowledge isn’t free. You have to pay attention.”

I love this quote.

It says so much about how attention economy works and the transformation of social media platforms. A modern version of the quote, hence, would go like this: “*Information* isn’t free. You have to pay attention.”

If you’re on your phone just for the sake of getting more information, put it down and live in the present. Otherwise, you’re always paying something.
