An *observer* feels something is wrong. He raises his concerns. He doesn’t come up with possible solutions.

A *solver* feels something is wrong. Identify what’s wrong. And come up with a solution.

A problem observer will always be seeing problems. At some point, they get annoyed. Because **all they see is problem**.

A problem solver takes actions. She solves a problem, or not solves a problem by admitting its presence. She’s able to move on with her life and learn on her way.
