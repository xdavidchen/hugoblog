At this very moment, how many tabs have you opened in the browser?

Okay. The number doesn't actually matter.
What matters is this: Before you sleep, do you always **quit** the application (i.e. closing Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple's Safari, etc...), or keep the tabs open for tomorrow?

I've seen people opening 20 tabs at once.\
To be honest, I should count myself in as one of them, too. I do this when some heavy research work is going on.

However, I never leave my browser application active overnight.\
That is, **no tabs before bed**.

This habit has helped me select the information effectively, and let me sleep well during night.

This is a distinction between **having and not having a focus** when consuming information.\
When you open up multiple tabs in the browser trying to find information, there's a high chance you'll feel lost and overwhelmed by the amount of information you need to go through.\
If you can practice focusing on one task, solving one problem at a time, you'll find yourself quitting the browser more often than everyday before you sleep.\
In fact, your browser would remain inactive most of the time, if you do it right.

It's about getting things done.\
It's about knowing what you're finding.\
It's about organizing what you've learned.
