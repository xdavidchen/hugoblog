Lying in bed listening to my favorite podcast one night...

"*What time is it*?" I realized I might have been in bed for too long.\
I picked up my phone and unlocked the screen.\
Checked Slack just in case I missed an important update from my boss.\
Nothing new. What about Hacker News? Browsing now...\
Oh wait... Figma is acquired by Adobe? RIP.\
Actually, let's fight big techs by using Brave browser to watch ad-free videos.\
So Casey Neistat is back in New York City. Cool.\
"I wish I could visit nyc again soon" – from my inner voice.\
Go on to Skyscanner.\
$1,500USD for a goddamn one-way flight ticket?!\
Anyway, how's life with my friends living in the U.S.?\
Maybe I should give them a call…

"Wait… *what time is it?*"
