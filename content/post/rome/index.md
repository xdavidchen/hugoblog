In *Atomic Habit*, you will learn the compounding effects of habits.

Anyone who has just finished reading the book would be prompt to start good habits.

The first day of a new habit is when we become extreme optimists. We naively believe that we could built it within a day, or 21-day the longest it takes — the pitfall we fall into.

You can't expect yourself to build a working system in a day.

In reality, it is a long and iterative process.\
It is building a functioning system that is stable, efficient, and reliable.\
Once you build one, there will be detail left for you to improve and perfect – so called maintenance.

Knowing all this, you're ready to put in the time and effort to build some good habits.
