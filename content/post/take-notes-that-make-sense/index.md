Think for a moment, how many places are you keeping your notes? How many notes did you make? Out of so many notes you’ve taken, how many of them make sense to you?

You can scrap all of them if none of them make sense.\
You can scrap most of them if most of them don’t make sense.\
A note is useful only when it makes sense.

Don’t try to fool yourself by thinking you’ll revisit these notes and make sense of them in the future.\
That’s a lie. It never happens.
