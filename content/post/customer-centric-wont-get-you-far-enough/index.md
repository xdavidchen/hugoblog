Taking a Coursera course about markeitng analytics, the lecturer emphasized on a concept at the very beginning: your business should be customer-centric.

Fair enough.

The time of products finding market-fit has passed. There are too many products and service out there already. Those who win customer's heart would win the game eventually. But it would not change any business whatsoever, if we just keep emphasizing on the importantce of being customer-centric.

When we tune our minds to think in terms of customer-centric, we start brainstorming on how we can solve customer's problems, with an end goal in mind. We would be able to switch our point of view. We would be looking at our own business from customer's perspective. And we would also be thinking, "What problems can I solve to *make a sale*?"

And we, again, start coming up with ideas for marketing campaigns, new versions of sales decks, or whatever that would **boost the sales numbers**. We can lose our focus quickly when we associate problem-solving with making money.

If we go one step further, and think in terms of **human-centric**, we would be able to solve the problems more fundamentally.

We would think as if we're living other people's lives. We would know why the problems exist at the first place. We would know the reason behind each actions. We would dig deeper to human's basic needs to find the real cause.

This is how we should be doing businesses.
