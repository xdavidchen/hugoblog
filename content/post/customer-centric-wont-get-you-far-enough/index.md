Taking a Coursera course about markeitng analytics, the lecturer emphasized on a concept at the very beginning: your business should be customer-centric.

Fair enough.

The time of products finding market-fit has passed. There are too many products and service out there already. It is those who win customer's heart would win the game eventually. But it would not change any business whatsoever, if we just keep emphasizing on the importantce of customer-centric.

When we tune our minds to think about customer-centric, we start brainstorming how to solve customer's problems, with an end goal in mind. We would be able to switch our point of view. We would be llooking at our own business from customer's perspective. And we would be thinking, "What problems can I solve to *make a sale*?"

And we, again, start coming up with ideas for marketing campaigns, new versions of sales decks, or whatever that would boost the sales numbers. We lose our focus quickly when we associate problem-solving with making money.

If we go one step further, and think in terms of human-centric, we would be able to solve the real problems.

We would think as if we're living other people's lives. We would know why the problems exist at the first place. We would know the reason behind each actions. We would dig deeper to human's basic needs to find the real cause.

This is how we should be doing businesses.
