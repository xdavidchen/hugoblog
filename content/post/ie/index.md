It's easy to lose focus when we're starting out to create.\
The work we put out should always be somewhat useful. Otherwise, it could have been an entry in the private journal.

Regardless of the format of your work, be it drawing, video, architect, writing, etc., **your work serves a purpose**.

A useful work of a creator does one or a combination of the following, it:
- gives people facts and information, AND/OR
- provides people with enjoyment, AND/OR
- makes people feel the urge to take actions.

"I & E" are the two ways for you to remember them.\
**I**nform, **I**nterest, and **I**nspire.\
**E**ducate, **E**ntertain, and **E**ncourage.
