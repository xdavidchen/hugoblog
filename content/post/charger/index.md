CPU is equivalent to computer's brain.

Pay attention to how much brain capacity you're using while doing tasks on your digital devices, you'll soon realize this: how much CPU your computer is using is almost the same as how much energy resource it takes for you to operate the task.

The faster your laptop battery runs out, the more energy you need to devote to complete the task.

To prevent your human brain CPU from overheating, treat your computer the same way you treat your brain. Both of them can work intelligently, are capable of operating complex tasks, and both **need rest**.

The next time you do your work at a caf√©, library, or office, leave the laptop charger at home to avoid burnout.\
It optimizes your work quality in two ways:
- It forces you to be focus at work.
- It sets a limitation of your working hours.

A "killing two birds with one stone" solution.
