Hello, å“ˆå›‰, Hallo! I'm David. I was born and grew up in Taiwan. I graduated as an English major. In life, I identify myself as an Ambivert.

## What's this blog about?

I'm here to **remind you of various ways to enjoy your life**.

Growing up, people around me are always comparing. Later I would learn all these comparison thing is a global phenomenon. It's just expressed through different ways and forms in different cultures.

***Get more and do better.*** That's the loudest voice in the world.

Soon it becomes toxic if we don't realize that we ought to be grateful of the life we're currently living.

**Pause, have a break, and look back.** This way, we are able to appreciate a lot more than just keep going.
