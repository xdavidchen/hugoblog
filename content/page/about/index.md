## Welcome to my personal blog

Hello, å“ˆå›‰, Hallo! I'm David. I was born and grew up in Taiwan. An English major. An introvert.

If you're smart enough, you can already tell I speak 3 languages, though my German sucks. And you might be wondering why you are seeing English on this blog, considering Mandarin is my native and the only language I use fluently. Receiving all the educational trainings in English during college has made me feel much more comfortable expressing myself in English. I consider this blog a place for me to explore and express. Hence it's going to be in English.

## Are you an old man? Modern people don't do blogging anymore

Well... I'm old enough to make thoughtful decisions. And cutting down the use of social media platforms is one of the best decisions I've made in life so far. I quitted social media **completely** for almost a year in 2021.

Now some of you guys are shouting "**I see you have a public Instagram account!**" The only reason I'm back on social media this year is that I see them as platforms for self-promotion. I'm a passionate learner. I learn photography, graphic design, and illustration, and many more. The platforms will only be served as places for me to share my work, post educational content, and mainly â€” **tell people the existence of this blog you're reading.**

If you're now a bit more convinced and curious of who I am, then below are some interests of mine:

- I (kind of) like traveling, I've been to quite a few countries ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡© ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡´ ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¬ ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¹ ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡º ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¿ ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡ª ğŸ‡±ğŸ‡º ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·. And I have tons of anecdotes to share. 
- I'm trying to understand the computer world. Specifically front-end development at this stage. The main reason is that I work at a [software startup](https://giftpack.ai/). And people are geeks there.
- I read a lot. I'll try to organize my thoughts and share them on this blog.

Lastly, [I'm actually an introvert](https://xdavidchen.com/p/c2c-from-a-consumer-to-a-creator/), though most of the people (and many of my real life friends) can't tell. It's extremely difficult for me to be courageous enough to speak up and share my personal thoughts on life. *Disclaimer: I speak up very well in classrooms.* After years of thinking and reflecting, I decided to put up this blog and started sharing my personal development. I encourage you (if you're an introvert too) do the same and let the world hear you whenever you're ready.

## If you are so touched that you have to reach out to me:

As I said, I'm not a big fan of social media. But if you have to send me a dm, then here's [my Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/x_david_chen/). Please don't expect me following back. I don't open it often. And I hate social comparisons.

The preffered way for conneting with me is through email. Send me your thoughts, comments, and feedback to this email address: [xdavidchen@tutlamail.com](mailto:xdavidchen@tutamail.com)

I'll reply you when I have the time. (replies are totally **NOT** guaranteed)

Oh, and for those who have already added me on your chatting apps, you're in luck, cuz not many people have it.
