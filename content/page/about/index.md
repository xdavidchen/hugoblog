Hello, å“ˆå›‰, Servus, it's really nice to see you here.

Since you're on the "About" page, I assume you'd like to know me better (you already learn that I speak 3 languages, although my German sucks).

### AUTOBIOGRAPHY... kind of
I was born and raised in Taiwan ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼, graduated as an English major from Fu Jen Catholic University, currectly being employed as a Digital Marketer at an internationally-operated startup.

### Chapter 1: The Beginning of My English Learning Journey
My interest in learning English grew when I first visited the U.S ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ in the summer before going to junior high school. It was 10 years ago. Can you believe how fast time flies? I spent the typical Taiwanese 2-month summer vacation in Nashville, Tenesse with my aunt and the family.

Going back to Taiwan, I was almost always the number one killing all the English tests at school (Not to brag. Ask Duncan, my English teacher). Learning becaouse of personal interest will bring the best result. That's why I'm quite competent with using English. My goal is to use the language like a native (though it's technically impossible, but I'm trying my best).

### Chapter 2: Why I'm Using English but not Mandarin
I'm a native Mandarin Chinese speaker. I don't sound native in English. So why the hell am I using English instead of my native language? The biggest reason is that education in Taiwan is SAD. It's always supressed. Students don't get to talk in classrooms. Plus, my parents grew up under a historical background that was even more conservative (surprise!), my family is just one of the typical ones in Asian culture. We don't really express our feelings, even to the closest friends and siblings.

Majoring in English in college, I was fortunate enough to meet some amazing professors and mentors, who helped me grow confidence expressing myself (only limited to academia though) in English. Now I'm pretty sure I have 2 total different personalities while using 2 languages. And English, if you're smart enough, is the language I feel much more comfortable for self-expression.

### Chapter 3: My Study Abroad Experience (during COVID)
I'm too tired recalling from memory and organizing thoughts now. Just let me jot down some notes. I'll get back and write okay?

- It has to do with the trip to the States.
- Vanderbilt
- FJU dual degree
- Startup
- University of Bayreuth
- FAILURE!!

### Chapter 4: I Fell in Love with Travelling (again... kind of)
