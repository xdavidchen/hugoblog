### About this blog
On this blog, I share little inspirations from life.

These posts are categorized under **self-development**, **creator**, and **business**.

>There's always another way to look at things â€” your way.

### About me
Originally from Taiwan, I spent my last year of college in Germany for a second bachelor's degree, which I failed to get. But I took the chance to solo-travel around Europe. The experience is what gave me the courage to share, and where a big part of my creative inspiration comes from.

Professionally, I work remotely as a Digital Marketer at a software startup. This job gives me the chance to live a nomadic lifestyle. It's been fun and chaotic. I'd also love to share my personal tips on how you can work and travel the same time.

I create content in both English and Traditional Chinese because my brain works differently when I use different languages.

On this English blog, you'll be inspired to start thinking creatively.

>The only goal I want to achieve with this blog is you thinking "**I've never thought of this that way!**"

For Chinese content, I share my personal stories and reflection traveling around the world. So if you happen to be a bilingual in these two languages, you're in luck! You get to know both sides of me!
