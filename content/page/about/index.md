### About this blog
Honestly, the reason this blog exists is simple: I'm too lazy.

People around me often ask me questions like what I'm busy with, what's up with my life, and how I get to this point of life. I'd love to share everything with you, but that'll take forever. And to make an ambivert start talking is another mission impossible. 

So this blog is everything I have. The question is how eager do you want to know?

>There's always another way to look at things â€” your way.

In this blog, you'll read articles under topics of **self-development**, **creator**, and **business**.\
I hope the lessons I've learnt from life remind you of how much potential there is in you.

### About me
I'm originally from Taiwan. I spent my last year of college in Germany for a second bachelor's degree in English, which I failed to get. But I took the chance to solo-travel around Europe. The experience is where a big part of my creative inspiration comes from.

Professionally, I've been working remotely as a Digital Marketer at a software startup for more than 2 years. This gives me a chance to experience nomadic lifestyle. It's been fun and chaotic at the same time. I'd also love to share my personal tips on how you can work and travel the same time.

I create content in both English and Traditional Chinese because my brain works differently when I use different languages.

On this English blog, you'll be inspired to start thinking creatively.

>The only goal I want to achieve with this blog? You thinking "**Oh, I've never thought of this in that way!**"

Switching to Chinese, I share my stories traveling around the world. So if you happen to be a bilingual in these two languages, you're in luck! You get to know both sides of me!
