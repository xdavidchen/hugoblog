### About this blog
Honestly, the reason this blog exists is simple: I'm too lazy.

People around me often ask me questions like what I'm busy with, what's up with my life, and how I get to this point of life. I'd love to share everything with you guys. Buy that'll take forever. And to make an ambivert start talking is another mission impossible. 

Simply put, it’s too difficult to explain everything in short. Even if I could, you might not be able to make sense of the stories because I will always miss some important parts.

So here, this blog, is everything I have. The question is, how eager do you want to know?

>There's always another way to look at things — your way.

In this blog, you'll find me sharing my reflection on life.

I hope my way of looking life reminds you of how unique your existance is, and how much potential is there in you.

As I identify myself as a content creator, I'll be talking about everything related to **content creation**. From **graphic design, photography, some level of tech**, to **business, creator's mindsets**, and lifestyle, of course.

### About me
I'm originally from Taiwan. I spent my last year of college in Germany for a second bachelor's degree in English, which I failed to get. But I took the chance to solo-travel around Europe. The experience is where a big portion of my creative inspiration comes from.

Professionally, I've been working remotely as a Digital Marketer at a software startup for more than 2 years. This gives me a chance to live a nomadic life. It's fun and chaotic at the same time. I'd also love to share my personal tips on how you can work and travel the same time.

I create content in both English and Traditional Chinese because my brain works differently when I use different languages.

In the English articles, I share thoughts and reflection that's more internal and personal.

Swiching to Chinese, I share all the stories I've had while traveling around the world. So if you happen to be a bilingual in these two languages, you're in luck! Cause you get to know both sides of me!

>The only goal I want to achieve with this blog is to **have you inspired** when you close the tab.
