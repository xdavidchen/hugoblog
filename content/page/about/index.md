Hi, I’m David Chen. On this website, I share things I love. It could be related to self-help, lifestyle, business, design, photography, or simply my personal life.

Call this a personal website, a blog, or my social media. It’s a space where I enjoy the purity of sharing.

I live a simple yet meaningful life. I invite you to follow this journey and hope you’ll have your own takeaways along with it.

If you know someone who would benefit from what I share, please feel free to spread the words.

To get updates, sign up for the blog newsletters, follow this social media, or subscribe by using RSS… you get the idea, they’re essentially the same thing.
