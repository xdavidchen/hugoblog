## Welcome to David's blog

Hello, å“ˆå›‰, Hallo! I'm David. I was born and grew up in Taiwan. An English major. An Ambivert.

My mission is to **inspire people to appreciate the uniqueness of the ordinary**. It's also why I started this blog at the beginning.

Growing up in Taiwan, people are surrounded by all kinds of comparisons. Despite there are culture differences between the East and the Western worlds, I learnt that this comparing thing is a global phenomenon. It's expressed through various ways and forms.

***Get more and do better.*** That's what the world keeps telling us.

Soon it becomes toxic without realizing how grateful we should be of the life we're currently living.

## Some fun facts about me
- I (kind of) like traveling, I've been to quite a few countries ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡© ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡´ ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡¬ ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¹ ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡º ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¿ ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡ª ğŸ‡±ğŸ‡º ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·. And I have tons of stories to share.
- I'm trying to understand the computer world. Specifically front-end development at this stage. The main reason is that I work at a [software startup](https://giftpack.ai/). And people are geeks there.
- I'm into design too. If you're into Graphic Design, Illustration, or Motion Graphics, share your work with me!
- I read a lot. I'll try to organize my thoughts and share them on this blog. They're going to be helpful I promise.
