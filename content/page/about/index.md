Hi, I’m David Chen. On this website, I share things I love here, projects I’m working on, and how-tos guides. Topics range from lifestyle, business, design, photography, to simply my personal life.

Call this a personal website, a lifestyle blog, or my social media. It’s a space where I enjoy the purity of sharing.

I live a simple yet meaningful life. I invite you to follow this journey and hope you’ll have some takeaways here and there along with it.

If you know someone who would benefit from what I share, please feel free to spread the words.

To get updates, sign up for the blog newsletters, follow this social media, or subscribe by using RSS… you get the idea, they’re essentially the same thing.
