### About this blog
Honestly, the reason this blog exists is simple: I'm too lazy.

The people I've met often ask me questions like what I'm busy with, what's up with my life, and how I got to this point of life. I'd love to share everything with you guys. Buy that'll take forever. And to make an ambivert start talking is another mission impossible. Simply put, itâ€™s too difficult to explain everything in short. Even if I could, the people asking might not be able to understand because I will always miss some important anecdotes.

So here, this blog, is everything I have. The question is, how eager do you want to know?

In this blog, you'll find me sharing my reflection on life. As I identify myself as a content creator, I'll be talking about everything related to **content creation**. From **graphic design, photography, some level of tech**, to **business, and creator's mindsets**, and many more. All of which are the skills I believe a modern creator should equip with.

### About me
I'm originally from Taiwan. I spent my last year of college in Germany for a second bachelor's degree in English, which I failed to get. But I took the chance to solo-travel around Europe. Until today I've been working remotely as a digital marketer at a software startup for more than 2 years. This gives me a chance to live a nomadic life. It's fun and chaotic at the same time.

I create content in both English and Traditional Chinese because my brain works differently when I use different languages. In the English articles, I'll be sharing thoughts and reflection that's more personal. In the Chinese articles, I'll be sharing all the stories I had while traveling around the world. So if you happen to be a bilingual in these two languages, you're in luck! You get to know both sides of me!

The only goal I want to achieve with this blog is to **have you inspired** when you close the tab on whatever device you are using.
