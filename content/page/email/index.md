Hey friends,<br>
If you enjoy reading my content and want to stay updated with me, consider joining my email list by typing in your name and email. <br> Not only you can share your thoughts with me just like you do with other people on social media, you'll also get my newsletter once in awhile to know my life updates.

Once you click subscribe, the following should happen:
1. Receive a confirmation email (might be in your spam or trash folder) 
2. After you've confirmed, you'll receive a welcome email (might still be in spam or trash folder)
3. Put me into your contact (or whitelist) so the email never goes to spam / trash folder again.
