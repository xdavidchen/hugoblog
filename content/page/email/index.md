Hey friends,

As you know, I'm not very consistent with social media.
Even if you follow me and I follow you back, when Instagram goes bankrupt then our connection dies, too.

Consider joining my email list by submitting your name and email. This is the best way for us to stay in touch.

*You should receive 2 emails after you submit.

*You might need to check your Spam or Trash folder to find the confirmation email and a welcome email.

*Put me into your whitelist (or Contact) so that my future mails will go directly into your inbox.

Alright that's it for now, see you there.
